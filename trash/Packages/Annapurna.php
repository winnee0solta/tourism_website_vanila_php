		<h1>Annapurna</h1>
		<p>Embark on one of the most challenging treks in Nepal and climb up to the Annapurna base camp to witness the breathtaking scenery and wonderful views Nepal's mountain range has to offer. Your trip starts with a pick up from your hotel in Pokhara, taking you to Naya Pul. From there, you will walk to Birethanti, the starting point of the trek and the challenge begins. On this trek, you will pass through Ghandruk, Chhomrong, Dovan, Machhapuchhre Base Camp before finally reaching Annapurna Base Camp—hiking through lush forests, cascading waterfalls and sweeping valleys; sleeping in quaint teahouses; constantly challenging your body to do more and climb higher (literally!)—all while learning more and more about the Annapurna Mountain range. The entire time, you will be accompanied by a knowledgable and experienced guide (and sherpas) who will support you and ensure your group’s safety every step of the way. Rest assured, the climb to Annapurna Base Camp will be one experience you will never forget.</p>
