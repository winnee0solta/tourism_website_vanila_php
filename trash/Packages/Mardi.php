		<h1>Mardi</h1>
		<p>Mardi Himal trek was accessed only by limited trekking groups with tents and catering team for long time. The trek follows beaten trails of shepherds as it still provides summer grazing. The trek was officially opened in 2012 and is still pristine. There are limited teahouses with basic facilities. This is a short relatively easy and unspoiled trek not far from Pokhara. Yet it is highly diverse with cultural insight, beautiful forest walks and alpine landscape. As the trail mostly stays along the ridge, the altitude gain becomes more gradual.</p>
